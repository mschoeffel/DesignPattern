Yes, but one can only chain to **one** constructor - and it has to be the **first statement** in your constructor body. Keyword to call another constructor of the same class is `this()`.\
Example:
```java
public class Foo {
    private int x;

    public Foo() {
        this(1); //Call other Constructor; is first statement of the Constructor itself
    }

    public Foo(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
}
```

If you get to this point I'd definitely prefer to put the loops in a different method, at which point you can just return to stop iterating completely. This answer just shows how the requirements in the question can be met.\
You can use `break` with a label for the outer loop. For example:
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        outerloop:
        for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j < 5; j++) {
                if (i * j > 6) {
                    System.out.println("Breaking");
                    break outerloop;
                }
                System.out.println(i + " " + j);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
}
```
The output is:
```

1 0

## Exception handling
## <a name="q-8-1"></a> 8.1 Why is exception handling important?
## <a name="q-8-2"></a> 8.2 What design pattern is used to implement exception handling features in most languages?
## <a name="q-8-3"></a> 8.3 What is the need for finally block?
## <a name="q-8-4"></a> 8.4 In what scenarios is code in finally not executed?
## <a name="q-8-5"></a> 8.5 Does `finally` always execute?
Yes, `finally` will be called after the execution of the `try` or `catch` code blocks.

The only times `finally` won't be called are:
1. If you invoke `System.exit()`
2. If the JVM crashes first
3. If the JVM reaches an infinite loop (or some other non-interruptable, non-terminating statement) in the `try` or `catch` block
4. If the OS forcibly terminates the JVM process; e.g., `kill -9 <pid>` on UNIX
5. If the host system dies; e.g., power failure, hardware error, OS panic, et cetera
6. If the `finall`y block is going to be executed by a daemon thread and all other non-daemon threads exit before `finally` is called

## <a name="q-9-26"></a> 9.26 Is Java "pass-by-reference" or "pass-by-value"?
Java is always "pass-by-value" but if you pass an `object`, java is passing the value of the address(reference).

## <a name="q-9-27"></a> 9.27 How can you create a memory leak in Java?
A good way to create a true memory leak (objects inaccessible by running code but still stored in memory) in pure Java:

1. The application creates a long-running thread (or use a thread pool to leak even faster).
2. The thread loads a `class` via an (optionally custom) `ClassLoader`.
3. The `class` allocates a large chunk of memory (e.g. `new byte[1000000]`), stores a strong reference to it in a static field, and then stores a reference to itself in a ThreadLocal. Allocating the extra memory is optional (leaking the Class instance is enough), but it will make the leak work that much faster.
4. The thread clears all references to the custom class or the ClassLoader it was loaded from.
5. Repeat.

This works because the `ThreadLocal` keeps a reference to the `object`, which keeps a reference to its Class, which in turn keeps a reference to its `ClassLoader`. The `ClassLoader`, in turn, keeps a reference to all the Classes it has loaded.

(It was worse in many JVM implementations, especially prior to Java 7, because Classes and ClassLoaders were allocated straight into permgen and were never GC'd at all. However, regardless of how the JVM handles class unloading, a ThreadLocal will still prevent a Class object from being reclaimed.)

A variation on this pattern is why application containers (like Tomcat) can leak memory like a sieve if you frequently redeploy applications that happen to use `ThreadLocals` in any way. (Since the application container uses Threads as described, and each time you redeploy the application a new `ClassLoader` is used.)

## <a name="q-9-28"></a> 9.28 What is reflection and why is it useful?
The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).

For example, say you have an `object` of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the `object` and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.

So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo):
```java
Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod("doSomething", null);
method.invoke(foo, null);
```
One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the `@Test` annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.

There are some good reflection examples to get started at [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html).
The usecase of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.

Note:
> The ability to inspect the code in the system and see object types is not reflection, but rather Type Introspection. Reflection is then the ability to make modifications at runtime by making use of introspection. The distinction is necessary here as some languages support introspection, but do not support reflection. One such example is C++

## <a name="q-10-34"></a> 10.34 What are two differences between a HashMap and a Hashtable?
There are several differences between `HashMap` and `Hashtable` in Java:
1. `Hashtable` is synchronized, whereas `HashMap` is not. This makes `HashMa`p better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.
2. `Hashtable` does not allow `null` keys or values. `HashMap` allows one `null` key and any number of `null` values.
3. One of HashMap's subclasses is `LinkedHashMap`, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the `HashMap` for a  `LinkedHashMap`. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using `Hashtable`.

## <a name="q-15-3"></a> 15.3 What are the new features in Java 7?
## <a name="q-15-4"></a> 15.4 What are the new features in Java 8?

## Best Practices
## <a name="q-16-1"></a> 16.1 What are different techniques for avoiding != null statements (Not Null Check)?
This a quite common problem that junior to intermediate developers tend to face at some point: they either don't know or don't trust the contracts they are participating in and defensively overcheck for `null`s. Additionally, when writing their own code, they tend to rely on returning `nulls` to indicate something thus requiring the caller to check for `null`s.
To put this another way, there are two instances where null checking comes up:
1. Where `null` is a valid response in terms of the contract; and
2. Where it isn't a valid response.

(2) is easy. Either use `assert` statements (assertions) or allow failure (for example, `NullPointerException`). Assertions are a highly-underused Java feature that was added in 1.4. The syntax is:
```java
assert <condition>
```
or
```java
assert <condition> : <object>
```
where `<condition>` is a boolean expression and `<object>` is an object whose `toString()` method's output will be included in the error.

An assert statement throws an `Error` (`AssertionError`) if the condition is not true. By default, Java ignores assertions. You can enable assertions by passing the option `-ea` to the JVM. You can enable and disable assertions for individual classes and packages. This means that you can validate code with the assertions while developing and testing, and disable them in a production environment, although my testing has shown next to no performance impact from assertions.

(1) is a little harder. If you have no control over the code you're calling then you're stuck. If null is a valid response, you have to check for it.

If it's code that you do control, however (and this is often the case), then it's a different story. Avoid using nulls as a response. With methods that return collections, it's easy: return empty collections (or arrays) instead of nulls pretty much all the time.

With non-collections it might be harder. There you should make use of the `Null Object Pattern`

## <a name="q-16-2"></a> 16.2 How to avoid `NullPointerException` when comparing Strings?
Sometimes you may have to compare two Strings.
Without much thinking you could write code like this:
```java
public void testMyString(String testStr){
    testStr.equals("mySample");
}
```
But what happens if the `testStr` is or could be `null` due to bad design of the Software or because you can't change where you get the `String` from?
A `NullPointerException` will be thrown.\
You can easily improve the code so that no `Exception` will be thrown if the `String` you get to test is `null`:
```java
public void testMyString(String testStr){
    "mySample".equals(testStr);
}
```
This easy switch prevents your code from throwing a `NullpointerException` and helps your Software to keep stable. If the `testStr` is `null` the `equlas()` Method will automatically return `false` and the Software will work furtheron.

## <a name="q-16-3"></a> 16.3 How to concatenate Strings faster and more efficient?
If you append or modify a `String` inside of a loop or a lot of modifications are done with this `String` a `StringBuilder` should be used:
Bad example:
```java
private String example(){
    String result = "My Starting String";

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        result += " Some append(" + i + ")";
    }

    return result;
}
```
Improved Code:
```java
private String example(){
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("My Starting String");

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        sb.append(" Some append(").append(i).append(")");
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
```

Another Improvement:

The starting point is something like this:
```java
String temp = "SELECT Item FROM Invoice WHERE id = '" + id + "'";
```
This code can be easily improved:
```java
String temp = "SELECT Item FROM Invoice WHERE id = '" + id + '\'';
```
This way the last add to the `String` will not be handled as `String`.Instead It will be handled as `char` and is an primitive datatype from java. This improvement gives the code a slightly better performance because only one `char` needs to be attatched instead of a potential Array of `char`s (like a `String` would be). The pervormance improvement from `a + "b"` to ` a + 'b'` is round about 10% (measured by benchmarks).\
Another performance point is the storage: A `char` can be stored in the moche faster Heap. A `String` will be normally stored in the slower Stack.

Note:
> Except some people always saying you should use a `StringBuilder` for such cases: Java automatically uses a `StringBuilder` for such cases in the background. Only in loops or if a lot gets appended a explicit StringBuilder is better in performance and best practice.

## <a name="q-16-4"></a> 16.4 Which one should be used, “implements Runnable” vs. “extends Thread”?
Implementing `Runnable` is the preferred way to do it. You're not really specialising the thread's behaviour. You're just giving it something to run. That means composition is the philosophically "purer" way to go.

In practical terms, it means you can implement `Runnable` and extend from another class as well.
