## Java Platform
## <a name="q-1-1"></a> 1.1 Why is Java so popular?
An important reason that contributes to the immense popularity enjoyed by Java is its platform independence or multiplatform support. Java programs are able to execute on different machines as long as there is a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) in place.
Since it has been around for so long, some of the biggest organisations in the world are built using the language. Many banks, retailers, insurance companies, utilities, and manufacturers all use Java.
Steve Zara, a programmer for more than 40 years, describes how there is no sign of Java declining in use. Instead, it is an evolving language which almost uniquely combines stability with innovation.

## <a name="q-1-2"></a> 1.2 What is platform independence?
Platform independence is a term that describes a technology (usually a ProgrammingLanguage or a FrameWork) that you can use to implement things on one machine and use them on another machine without (or with minimal) changes.\
There are two basic types of PlatformIndependence:
1. Binary Platform Independence:\
Languages like Java (JavaLanguage) or Python (PythonLanguage) use a VirtualMachine to run and therefore can be transported from one machine to another in their compiled, binary format. CsharpLanguage seems to be moving in that direction as well, by way of the MonoProject.
2. Source Platform Independence:\
ANSI C (CeeLanguage) and ANSI C++ (CeePlusPlus) could be considered platform independent to the extent that the source needs no change (or almost no change) to be moved from one type of machine to another. The source needs to be recompiled for each platform. If the programmer adheres to strict ANSI standards, programs in both languages should compile and run nicely on all platforms.

ScriptingLanguage / InterpretedLanguage platform independence PerlLanguage can also be listed here - it doesn't compile into a binary distributable and most Perl programs (especially text based ones) can run on many platforms. There needs to be an interpreter for each platform.

## <a name="q-1-3"></a> 1.3 What is bytecode?
Bytecode, also termed portable code or p-code, is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecodes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) that encode the result of compiler parsing and performing semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects.

## <a name="q-1-4"></a> 1.4 Compare JDK vs JVM vs JRE 
1. JDK:\
JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit to develop applications in Java. When you download JDK, JRE is also downloaded, and don't need to download it separately. In addition to JRE, JDK also contains number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger etc).
2. JVM:\
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables your computer to run a Java program.\
When you run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles your Java code to bytecode. Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU executes directly).\
Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when you write Java code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not your physical machine (computer). Since, JVM ​executes the Java bytecode which is platform independent, Java is platform-independent.
3. JRE:\
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a software package that provides Java class libraries, along with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applications written in Java programming. JRE is the superset of JVM.

## <a name="q-1-5"></a> 1.5 What are the important differences between C++ and Java?
Topic | Java | C++
----|----|----
Memory Management | Conrolled by system, does not use pointers. Supports Threads and Interfaces. | Managed by developers using pointers. Supports structures and union.
Inheritance | Does not support multiple inheritance. Uses the concept of Interface to achieve. | Provides single and multiple inheritance.
Runtime error detection mechanism | System's responsoility. | Programmer's responsobility.
Libraries | Provides wide range of classes for various high-level services. | Comparatively available with low-level functionalities.
Program Handling | All meethods and data reside in class itself. Concept of Package is used. | Methods and data can reside outside classes. Concept of global file, namespace scopes available.
Type Semantics | Differend for primitive and object types. | Supports consistent support between primitive and object types.
Portability| Uses concept of bytecode which is platform independent and can be used with platform specific JVM. | Platform dependent as source code must be recompiled for different platform.
Polymorphism | Automatic, uses static and dynamic binding. | Explicit for methods, supports mied hierarchies.

## <a name="q-1-6"></a> 1.6 What is the role for a classloader in Java?
Class loaders are responsible for loading Java classes during runtime dynamically to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Also, they are part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Hence, the JVM doesn’t need to know about the underlying files or file systems in order to run Java programs thanks to class loaders.

Also, these Java classes aren’t loaded into memory all at once, but when required by an context. This is where class loaders come into the picture. They are responsible for loading classes into memory.

## Wrapper Classes
## <a name="q-2-1"></a> 2.1 What are Wrapper classes?
A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types.

## <a name="q-2-2"></a> 2.2 Why do we need Wrapper classes in Java?
1. They convert primitive data types into objects. Objects are needed if we wish to modify the arguments passed into a method (because primitive types are passed by value).
2. The classes in java.util package handles only objects and hence wrapper classes help in this case also.
3. Data structures in the Collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects (reference types) and not primitive types.
4. An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.

## <a name="q-2-3"></a> 2.3 What are the different ways of creating Wrapper class instances?
1. Autoboxing\
You just set a value to the Wrapper instance:
```java
char ch = 'a';
Character a = ch;
//Or:
int i = 5;
Integer o = Integer.valueOf(i);
```
2. Constructor\
When instantiating a Wrapper you give the primitive type as Parameter in the constructor:
```java
int i = 5;
Integer o = new Integer(i);
```

## <a name="q-2-4"></a> 2.4 What are differences in the two ways of creating Wrapper classes?
## <a name="q-2-5"></a> 2.5 What is auto boxing?
## <a name="q-2-6"></a> 2.6 What are the advantages of auto boxing?
## <a name="q-2-7"></a> 2.7 What is casting?
Type Casting in Java is nothing but converting a primitive or interface or class in Java into other type. There is a rule in Java Language that classes or interface which shares the same type hierrachy only can be typecasted. If there is no relationship between then Java will throw ClassCastException.\
Type casting are of two types they are:
1. Implicit Casting (Widening)
2. Explicit Casting (Narrowing)

## <a name="q-2-8"></a> 2.8 What is implicit casting?
No Explicit casting required if you are widenting the datatype from smaller to larger or child to parent.\
Example:
```java
public class Implicit_Casting_Example {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        byte i = 50;
        // No casting needed for below conversion
        short j = i;
        int k = j;
        long l = k;
        float m = l;
        double n = m;
    }
}
```

## <a name="q-2-9"></a> 2.9 What is explicit casting?
When you are assigning a larger type to a smaller type, then Explicit Casting is required. Also if you are narrowing from a parent class to a child class\
Example:
```java
public class Explicit_Casting_Example {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        double d = 75.0;
        // Explicit casting is needed for below conversion
        float f = (float) d;
        long l = (long) f;
        int i  = (int) l;
        short s = (short) i;
        byte b = (byte) s;
    }
}
```

## Strings
## <a name="q-3-1"></a> 3.1 Are all String’s immutable?
All `String` are immutable in Java. An immutable class is simply a class whose instances cannot be modified. All information in an instance is initialized when the instance is created and the information can not be modified. There are many advantages of immutable classes.

## <a name="q-3-2"></a> 3.2 Where are String values stored in memory?
All the `String` objects will be stored in the heap.

## <a name="q-3-3"></a> 3.3 Why should you be careful about String concatenation(+) operator in loops?
## <a name="q-3-4"></a> 3.4 How do you solve above problem?
## <a name="q-3-5"></a> 3.5 What are differences between String and StringBuffer?
Basis | String | StringBuffer
----|----|----
Basic | The length of the String is fixed. | The length of the StringBuffer can be increased.
Modification | String object is immutable. | StringBuffer object is mutable.
Performance | It is slower during concatenation. | It is faster during concatenation.
Memory | Consumes more memory. | Consumes less memory.
Storage | String constant pool. (Inside of the Heap) | Heap memory.

## <a name="q-3-6"></a> 3.6 What are differences between StringBuilder and StringBuffer?
`StringBuilder` is faster than `StringBuffer` because it's not `synchronized`.
So if you are in a single threaded environment or don’' care about thread safety, you should use StringBuilder else use StringBuffer.

## <a name="q-3-7"></a> 3.7 Can you give examples of different utility methods in String class?
Some important String methods:
* `isEmpty()`: Checks if the String is empty.
* `length()`: Returns the length of the String.
* `charAt(index)`: Returns the char at a specific index.
* `contains(sample)`: Checks if the String contains the sample.
* `toLowerCase()`: Put's all characters of the String to lower case.
* `toUpperCase()`: Put's all characters of the String to upper case.

## Object oriented programming basics
## <a name="q-4-1"></a> 4.1 What is a class?
In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In many languages, the class name is used as the name for the class (the template itself), the name for the default constructor of the class (a subroutine that creates objects), and as the type of objects generated by instantiating the class; these distinct concepts are easily conflated.

## <a name="q-4-2"></a> 4.2 What is an object?
In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm, object refers to a particular instance of a class, where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.

## <a name="q-4-3"></a> 4.3 What is state of an object?
The state of an object are the attributes.

## <a name="q-4-4"></a> 4.4 What is behavior of an object?
The behaviour of an object are the methods.

## <a name="q-4-5"></a> 4.5 What is the super class of every class in Java?
Every class in Java inherits from the java `Object`.

## <a name="q-4-6"></a> 4.6 Explain about toString method ?
The `toString()` Methods gives a String representation of an object.

## <a name="q-4-7"></a> 4.7 What is the use of equals method in Java?
the `equals()` Method compares two objects if they are the same,

## <a name="q-4-8"></a> 4.8 What are the important things to consider when implementing equals method?
## <a name="q-4-9"></a> 4.9 What is the Hashcode method used for in Java?
## <a name="q-4-10"></a> 4.10 Explain inheritance.
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
* subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
* superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the `extends` keyword.

## <a name="q-4-11"></a> 4.11 What is method overloading?
Method overloading is when you code a method multiple times with different types and numbers of parameters.\
Example:
```java
public calculate(int a, int b){
    calculate((double)a, (double)b);
}

public calculate(double a, double b){
    //do some calculation
}
```

## <a name="q-4-12"></a> 4.12 What is method overriding?
Method overriding is when you write a method given from a parent class again in the child class with different functionality, mostly a more child specific functionality. It is considered good coding when you tag the method then with `@Override`.\
Example:
```java
public class parent{

    public void doSomeStuff(int a){
        //Do something
    }
}

public class child extends parent{
    
    @Override
    public void soSomeStuff(int a){
        //Do other more child specific stuff
    }
}
```
## <a name="q-4-13"></a> 4.13 Can super class reference variable can hold an object of sub class?
## <a name="q-4-14"></a> 4.14 Is multiple inheritance allowed in Java?
No multiple inheritance is not allowed in Java. Therefore you can make use of Interfaces.

## <a name="q-4-15"></a> 4.15 What is an interface?
An `interface` is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies.

## <a name="q-4-16"></a> 4.16 How do you define an interface?
You can define an interface like a cluss but instead of the class keywod `class` you use the keword `interface` and without any modifier.\
Example:
```java
interface MyInterface{
    //...
}
```

## <a name="q-4-17"></a> 4.17 How do you implement an interface?
You can implement an interface using the `implements` keword behind the class and the name of the Interface. If you want to implement multiple interfaces just write the names comma seperated. Then implement all the methods form the interface.\
Example:
```java
public class test implements MyInterface{
    //....
}
```

## <a name="q-4-18"></a> 4.18 Can you explain a few tricky things about interfaces?
## <a name="q-4-19"></a> 4.19 Can you extend an interface?
Yes an interface can extend another interface in ava. Therfore just use the `extends` keyword.

## <a name="q-4-20"></a> 4.20 Can a class implement multiple interfaces?
Yes a class can implement multiple interfaces therfore you just name the interfaces comma separated. You then have to implement all the methods of both interfaces in your class.

## <a name="q-4-21"></a> 4.21 What is an abstract class?
A abstract class is a special class that can't be instantiated.

## <a name="q-4-22"></a> 4.22 When do you use an abstract class?
If you want to group multiple classes but dont want to get an instance of this group element. For exmaple you got the classes Dog and Cat and wanna group them with a class Animal but the single instance of an animal would make less sense so you make the class Animal abstract.

## <a name="q-4-23"></a> 4.23 How do you define an abstract method?
An abstract method needs to have an empty body and the subclasses have to implement and override this method.

## <a name="q-4-24"></a> 4.24 Compare abstract class vs interface?
Difference between interface and abstract class:
1. Main difference is methods of a Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.
2. Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An  abstract class may contain non-final variables.
3. Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have the usual flavors of class members like private, protected, etc..
4. Java interface should be implemented using keyword “implements”; A Java abstract class should be extended using keyword “extends”.
5. An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
6. A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can extend only one abstract class.
7. Interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated; A Java abstract class also cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked if a main() exists.
8. In comparison with java abstract classes, java interfaces are slow as it requires extra indirection.

## <a name="q-4-25"></a> 4.25 What is a constructor?
The constructor is a special method that, by calling, creates a instance(object) of the class. The constructor also has always the same name as the class itself. A constructor can also be overriden by child classes or overloaded.

## <a name="q-4-26"></a> 4.26 What is a default constructor?
The default cunstructor is called when you want to instantiate an object without any parameter. Every instantiable class has one defaut constructor.\
Example:
```java
public class Test{

    //This is the default constructor: (Normally you don't have to code this)
    public Test(){}
}
```

## <a name="q-4-27"></a> 4.27 Will this code compile?
## <a name="q-4-28"></a> 4.28 How do you call a super class constructor from a constructor?
To call the constructor of the parent class you siply call `super()`.\
Example:
```java
public class parent{
    public parent(){
        //Initialize object
    }
}

public class child extends parent{
    public child(){
        super();
        //Initialize object
    }
}
```
## <a name="q-4-29"></a> 4.29 Will this code compile?
## <a name="q-4-30"></a> 4.30 What is the use of this()?
With `this()` you can call another constructor of the class.

## <a name="q-4-31"></a> 4.31 Can a constructor be called directly from a method?
## <a name="q-4-32"></a> 4.32 Is a super class constructor called even when there is no explicit call from a sub class constructor?
Yes, if a constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor, the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass. If the super class does not have a no-argument constructor, you will get a compile-time error. Object does have such a constructor, so if Object is the only superclass, there is no problem.

## <a name="q-4-33"></a> 4.33 Is it possible to call one constructor from another in Java?
Yes, but one can only chain to **one** constructor - and it has to be the **first statement** in your constructor body. Keyword to call another constructor of the same class is `this()`.\
Example:
```java
public class Foo {
    private int x;

    public Foo() {
        this(1); //Call other Constructor; is first statement of the Constructor itself
    }

    public Foo(int x) {
        this.x = x;
    }
}
```
## Advanced object oriented concepts
## <a name="q-5-1"></a> 5.1 What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

## <a name="q-5-2"></a> 5.2 What is the use of instanceof operator in Java?
The `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

## <a name="q-5-3"></a> 5.3 What is coupling?
In object oriented design, Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another. In other words, how often do changes in class A force related changes in class B.

## <a name="q-5-4"></a> 5.4 What is cohesion?
In object oriented design, cohesion refers all about how a single class is designed. Cohesion is the Object Oriented principle most closely associated with making sure that a class is designed with a single, well-focused purpose.
The more focused a class is, the cohesiveness of that class is more. The advantages of high cohesion is that such classes are much easier to maintain (and less frequently changed) than classes with low cohesion. Another benefit of high cohesion is that classes with a well-focused purpose tend to be more reusable than other classes.

## <a name="q-5-5"></a> 5.5 What is encapsulation?
## <a name="q-5-6"></a> 5.6 What is an inner class?
An inner class is a class that is defined within another class and can only be used inside of this class.

## <a name="q-5-7"></a> 5.7 What is a static inner class?
## <a name="q-5-8"></a> 5.8 Can you create an inner class inside a method?
## <a name="q-5-9"></a> 5.9 What is an anonymous class?

## Modifiers
## <a name="q-6-1"></a> 6.1 What is default class modifier?
## <a name="q-6-2"></a> 6.2 What is private access modifier?
Methods or attributes with the `private` modifier can only be called/seen by object itself.

## <a name="q-6-3"></a> 6.3 What is default or package access modifier?
## <a name="q-6-4"></a> 6.4 What is protected access modifier?

## <a name="q-6-5"></a> 6.5 What is public access modifier?
Methods or attributes with the `public` modifier can be called/seen by any object of the project.

## <a name="q-6-6"></a> 6.6 What access types of variables can be accessed from a class in same package?
`Package` and `public` attributes and methods of the other classes and all the attributes and methods of itseelf.

## <a name="q-6-7"></a> 6.7 What access types of variables can be accessed from a class in different package?
Only the `public` attributes and methods and all the attributes and methods of itself.

## <a name="q-6-8"></a> 6.8 What access types of variables can be accessed from a sub class in same package?
The same as the classes in the same package. But also all the attributes and methods of its super classes except private attributes and methods from superclass.

## <a name="q-6-9"></a> 6.9 What access types of variables can be accessed from a sub class in different package?
The same as the classes in different packages. But also all the attributes and methods of its super classes except private attributes and methods from superclass.

## <a name="q-6-10"></a> 6.10 What is the use of a final modifier on a class?
The final keyword on a class prevents the class from inheritance.

## <a name="q-6-11"></a> 6.11 What is the use of a final modifier on a method?
The final keyword on a method prevents the method from being overridden.

## <a name="q-6-12"></a> 6.12 What is a final variable?
A final variable is a variable that can't be 'changed' while runtime. So a final variable is a `constant`. If a variable is declared `final` that holds a object the object can be modified but the reference of the variable to the object alway keeps the same.

## <a name="q-6-13"></a> 6.13 What is a final argument?
A final parameter ensures that these won't accidentally be changed by the method.

## <a name="q-6-14"></a> 6.14 What happens when a variable is marked as volatile?
Using volatile is yet another way (like synchronized, atomic wrapper) of making class thread safe. Thread safe means that a method or class instance can be used by multiple threads at the same time without any problem.

## <a name="q-6-15"></a> 6.15 What is a static variable?
## <a name="q-6-16"></a> 6.16 What is the difference between volatile and synchronized?
First two important definitions:
1. Mutual Exclusion:\
It means that only one thread or process can execute a block of code (critical section) at a time.
2. Visibility:\
It means that changes made by one thread to shared data are visible to other threads.
Java’s synchronized keyword guarantees both mutual exclusion and visibility. If we make the blocks of threads that modifies the value of shared variable synchronized only one thread can enter the block and changes made by it will be reflected in the main memory. All other thread trying to enter the block at the same time will be blocked and put to sleep.

In some cases we may only desire the visibility and not atomicity. Use of synchronized in such situation is an overkill and may cause scalability problems. Here volatile comes to the rescue. Volatile variables have the visibility features of synchronized but not the atomicity features. The values of volatile variable will never be cached and all writes and reads will be done to and from the main memory. However, use of volatile is limited to very restricted set of cases as most of the times atomicity is desired. For example a simple increment statement such as x = x + 1; or x++ seems to be a single operation but is s really a compound read-modify-write sequence of operations that must execute atomically.

## Conditions & loops
## <a name="q-7-1"></a> 7.1 Why should you always use blocks around if statement?
## <a name="q-7-2"></a> 7.2 Should default be the last case in a switch statement?
## <a name="q-7-3"></a> 7.3 Can a switch statement be used around a String
## <a name="q-7-4"></a> 7.4 What is an enhanced for loop?
## <a name="q-7-5"></a> 7.5 Is it possible to break out of nested loops in Java?
If you get to this point I'd definitely prefer to put the loops in a different method, at which point you can just return to stop iterating completely. This answer just shows how the requirements in the question can be met.\
You can use `break` with a label for the outer loop. For example:
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        outerloop:
        for (int i=0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j < 5; j++) {
                if (i * j > 6) {
                    System.out.println("Breaking");
                    break outerloop;
                }
                System.out.println(i + " " + j);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Done");
    }
}
```
The output is:
```
0 0
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4
1 0
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 0
2 1
2 2
2 3
Breaking
Done
```


## Exception handling
## <a name="q-8-1"></a> 8.1 Why is exception handling important?
## <a name="q-8-2"></a> 8.2 What design pattern is used to implement exception handling features in most languages?
## <a name="q-8-3"></a> 8.3 What is the need for finally block?
## <a name="q-8-4"></a> 8.4 Does `finally` always execute?
Yes, `finally` will be called after the execution of the `try` or `catch` code blocks.

The only times `finally` won't be called are:
1. If you invoke `System.exit()`
2. If the JVM crashes first
3. If the JVM reaches an infinite loop (or some other non-interruptable, non-terminating statement) in the `try` or `catch` block
4. If the OS forcibly terminates the JVM process; e.g., `kill -9 <pid>` on UNIX
5. If the host system dies; e.g., power failure, hardware error, OS panic, et cetera
6. If the `finall`y block is going to be executed by a daemon thread and all other non-daemon threads exit before `finally` is called

## <a name="q-8-6"></a> 8.6 Is try without a catch is allowed?
Yes, we can have try without catch block by using finally block. You can use try with finally. As you know finally block always executes even if you have exception or return statement in try block.

## <a name="q-8-7"></a> 8.7 Is try without catch and finally allowed?
Yes, you can make use of the `try-with-ressources` block. 
Example:
```java
static String readFirstLineFromFile(String path) throws IOException {
    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
        return br.readLine();
    }
}
```

## <a name="q-8-8"></a> 8.8 Can you explain the hierarchy of exception handling classes?
## <a name="q-8-9"></a> 8.9 What is the difference between error and exception?
* **Error:**\
An Error “indicates serious problems that a reasonable context should not try to catch.”
Both Errors and Exceptions are the subclasses of java.lang.Throwable class. Errors are the conditions which cannot get recovered by any handling techniques. It surely cause termination of the program abnormally. Errors belong to unchecked type and mostly occur at runtime. Some of the examples of errors are Out of memory error or a System crash error.
* **Exceptions:**\
An Exception “indicates conditions that a reasonable context might want to catch.”
Exceptions are the conditions that occur at runtime and may cause the termination of program. But they are recoverable using try, catch and throw keywords. Exceptions are divided into two catagories : checked and unchecked exceptions. Checked exceptions like IOException known to the compiler at compile time while unchecked exceptions like ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException known to the compiler at runtime. It is mostly caused by the program written by the programmer.

## <a name="q-8-10"></a> 8.10 What is the difference between checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions?
## <a name="q-8-11"></a> 8.11 How do you throw an exception from a method?
Example:
```java
private void test(int i){
    if(i < 0){
        //Thorws an exception:
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Value must be positive");
    }
    //...
}
```

## <a name="q-8-12"></a> 8.12 What happens when you throw a checked exception from a method?
## <a name="q-8-13"></a> 8.13 What are the options you have to eliminate compilation errors when handling checked exceptions?
## <a name="q-8-14"></a> 8.14 How do you create a custom exception?
You simply create an own class that extends the class `Exception`.
Example:
```java
public class MyOwnException extends Exception{
    //Constructor, methods ...
}
```

## <a name="q-8-15"></a> 8.15 How do you handle multiple exception types with same exception handling block?
Separate the Exceptions wit the pipe character `|`.
Example:
```java
private void doSomething(){
    try{
        checkConnection();
    } catch(RemoteException | IllegalArgumentException | RuntimeException e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

## <a name="q-8-16"></a> 8.16 Can you explain about try with resources?
## <a name="q-8-17"></a> 8.17 How does try with resources work?
## <a name="q-8-18"></a> 8.18 Can you explain a few exception handling best practices?
Only catch specific Exceptions and no `Errors` or `Throwable`, because `Errors` need to be thrown until the top to show that the context has some serious problems and shouldn't be caught so that the context stops running.

## Miscellaneous topics
## <a name="q-9-1"></a> 9.1 What are the default values in an array?
Everything in a Java program not explicitly set to something by the programmer, is initialized to a zero value.
* For references (anything that holds an object) that is null.
* For int/short/byte/long that is a 0.
* For float/double that is a 0.0
* For booleans that is a false.
* For char that is the null character '\u0000' (whose decimal equivalent is 0).

When you create an array of something, all entries are also zeroed.

## <a name="q-9-2"></a> 9.2 How do you loop around an array using enhanced for loop?
## <a name="q-9-3"></a> 9.3 How do you print the content of an array?
## <a name="q-9-4"></a> 9.4 How do you compare two arrays?
## <a name="q-9-5"></a> 9.5 What is an enum?
An enum(short: Enumeration) is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).\
To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma. Note that they should be in uppercase letters.\
Example:
```java
enum Level{
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}

Level l = Level.MEDIUM;
```

With enums you can also make some pretty advanced stuff like gibe them differend funktions etc. seen in some design patterns.
## <a name="q-9-6"></a> 9.6 Can you use a switch statement around an enum?
Yes you can and should be used for good coding style.\
Example:
```java
enum Level{
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
}

Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 

    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
         System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
```

## <a name="q-9-7"></a> 9.7 What are variable arguments or varargs?
## <a name="q-9-8"></a> 9.8 What are asserts used for?
## <a name="q-9-9"></a> 9.9 When should asserts be used?
## <a name="q-9-10"></a> 9.10 What is garbage collection?
In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use by the program. Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in Lisp.\
Garbage collection is essentially the opposite of manual memory management, which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system.

## <a name="q-9-11"></a> 9.11 Can you explain garbage collection with an example?
## <a name="q-9-12"></a> 9.12 When is garbage collection run?
## <a name="q-9-13"></a> 9.13 What are best practices on garbage collection?
## <a name="q-9-14"></a> 9.14 What are initialization blocks?
## <a name="q-9-15"></a> 9.15 What is a static initializer?
## <a name="q-9-16"></a> 9.16 What is an instance initializer block?
## <a name="q-9-17"></a> 9.17 What is tokenizing?
## <a name="q-9-18"></a> 9.18 Can you give an example of tokenizing?
## <a name="q-9-19"></a> 9.19 What is serialization?
## <a name="q-9-20"></a> 9.20 How do you serialize an object using serializable interface?
## <a name="q-9-21"></a> 9.21 How do you de-serialize in Java?
## <a name="q-9-22"></a> 9.22 What do you do if only parts of the object have to be serialized?
## <a name="q-9-23"></a> 9.23 How do you serialize a hierarchy of objects?
## <a name="q-9-24"></a> 9.24 Are the constructors in an object invoked when it is de-serialized?
## <a name="q-9-25"></a> 9.25 Are the values of static variables stored when an object is serialized?
## <a name="q-9-26"></a> 9.26 Is Java "pass-by-reference" or "pass-by-value"?
Java is always "pass-by-value" but if you pass an `object`, java is passing the value of the address(reference).

## <a name="q-9-27"></a> 9.27 How can you create a memory leak in Java?
A good way to create a true memory leak (objects inaccessible by running code but still stored in memory) in pure Java:

1. The context creates a long-running thread (or use a thread pool to leak even faster).
2. The thread loads a `class` via an (optionally custom) `ClassLoader`.
3. The `class` allocates a large chunk of memory (e.g. `new byte[1000000]`), stores a strong reference to it in a static field, and then stores a reference to itself in a ThreadLocal. Allocating the extra memory is optional (leaking the Class instance is enough), but it will make the leak work that much faster.
4. The thread clears all references to the custom class or the ClassLoader it was loaded from.
5. Repeat.

This works because the `ThreadLocal` keeps a reference to the `object`, which keeps a reference to its Class, which in turn keeps a reference to its `ClassLoader`. The `ClassLoader`, in turn, keeps a reference to all the Classes it has loaded.

(It was worse in many JVM implementations, especially prior to Java 7, because Classes and ClassLoaders were allocated straight into permgen and were never GC'd at all. However, regardless of how the JVM handles class unloading, a ThreadLocal will still prevent a Class object from being reclaimed.)

A variation on this pattern is why context containers (like Tomcat) can leak memory like a sieve if you frequently redeploy applications that happen to use `ThreadLocals` in any way. (Since the context container uses Threads as described, and each time you redeploy the context a new `ClassLoader` is used.)

## <a name="q-9-28"></a> 9.28 What is reflection and why is it useful?
The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).

For example, say you have an `object` of an unknown type in Java, and you would like to call a 'doSomething' method on it if one exists. Java's static typing system isn't really designed to support this unless the object conforms to a known interface, but using reflection, your code can look at the `object` and find out if it has a method called 'doSomething' and then call it if you want to.

So, to give you a code example of this in Java (imagine the object in question is foo):
```java
Method method = foo.getClass().getMethod("doSomething", null);
method.invoke(foo, null);
```
One very common use case in Java is the usage with annotations. JUnit 4, for example, will use reflection to look through your classes for methods tagged with the `@Test` annotation, and will then call them when running the unit test.

There are some good reflection examples to get started at [http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/index.html).
The usecase of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common.

Note:
> The ability to inspect the code in the system and see object types is not reflection, but rather Type Introspection. Reflection is then the ability to make modifications at runtime by making use of introspection. The distinction is necessary here as some languages support introspection, but do not support reflection. One such example is C++

## <a name="q-10-34"></a> 10.34 What are two differences between a HashMap and a Hashtable?
There are several differences between `HashMap` and `Hashtable` in Java:
1. `Hashtable` is synchronized, whereas `HashMap` is not. This makes `HashMa`p better for non-threaded applications, as unsynchronized Objects typically perform better than synchronized ones.
2. `Hashtable` does not allow `null` keys or values. `HashMap` allows one `null` key and any number of `null` values.
3. One of HashMap's subclasses is `LinkedHashMap`, so in the event that you'd want predictable iteration order (which is insertion order by default), you could easily swap out the `HashMap` for a  `LinkedHashMap`. This wouldn't be as easy if you were using `Hashtable`.

## Advanced collections
## <a name="q-11-1"></a> 11.1 What is the difference between synchronized and concurrent collections in Java?
Synchronize means acquiring a reentrant lock on an object. The lock is released when either end of synchronized block is reached or thread goes into waiting state. The lock is reentrant in the sense that the same thread can acquire the lock again and again but a different thread cannot. So synchronized keyword essentially guards a piece of code to be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously

Concurrent collections are exactly opposite. They are called so because they allow multiple threads to concurrently access the same data. For example concurrent HashMap allows multiple threads to perform write operations in parallel as long as the writes are happening on different segments.

Also concurrent collections doesn't allow `null` keys and `null` values, whereas synchronized collections may allow `null` keys and `null` values based on the original collectionclass being passed inside it.

## Generics
## <a name="q-12-1"></a> 12.1 What are Generics?
Generics are a facility of generic programming that were added to the Java programming language in 2004 within version J2SE 5.0. They were designed to extend Java's type system to allow "a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety". The aspect compile-time type safety was not fully achieved, since it was shown in 2016 that it is not guaranteed in all cases.

## <a name="q-12-2"></a> 12.2 Why do we need Generics? Can you give an example of how Generics make a program more flexible?
## <a name="q-12-3"></a> 12.3 How do you declare a generic class?
Example:
```java
public class Entry<T, U>{
    private final T key;
    private final U value;

    public Entry(T key, U value){
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
    //Getter, Stter, ToString...
}
```

## <a name="q-12-4"></a> 12.4 What are the restrictions in using generic type that is declared in a class declaration?
## <a name="q-12-5"></a> 12.5 How can we restrict Generics to a subclass of particular class?
Example:
```java
public class Entry<? extends ParentClass>{
    private final ParendClass key;

    public Entry(ParentClass key){
        this.key = key;
    }
    //Getter, Stter, ToString...
}
```

## <a name="q-12-6"></a> 12.6 How can we restrict Generics to a super class of particular class?
Example:
```java
public class Entry<? super ChildClass>{
    private final ParendClass key;

    public Entry(ParentClass key){
        this.key = key;
    }
    //Getter, Stter, ToString...
}
```

## Functional Programming - Lamdba expressions and Streams
## <a name="q-14-1"></a> 14.1 What is functional programming?
## <a name="q-14-2"></a> 14.2 Can you give an example of functional programming?
## <a name="q-14-3"></a> 14.3 What is a stream?
## <a name="q-14-4"></a> 14.4 Explain about streams with an example?
## <a name="q-14-5"></a> 14.5 What are intermediate operations in streams?
Intermediate operations return another Stream which allows you to call multiple operations in a form of a query. Intermediate operations do not get executed until a terminal operation is invoked as there is a possibility they could be processed together when a terminal operation is executed.\
Operations:
* `filter`
* `map`
* `flatMap`
* `peek`
* `distinct`
* `sorted`
* `limit`

## <a name="q-14-6"></a> 14.6 What are terminal operations in streams?
Terminal operations produces a non-stream, result such as primitive value, a collection or no value at all. Terminal operations are typically preceded by intermediate operations which return another Stream which allows operations to be connected in a form of a query.\
Operations:
* `forEach`
* `toArray`
* `reduce`
* `collect`
* `min`
* `max`
* `count`
* `anyMatch`
* `allMatch`
* `noneMatch`
* `findFirst`
* `findAny`


## <a name="q-14-7"></a> 14.7 What are method references?
## <a name="q-14-8"></a> 14.8 What are lambda expressions?
One issue with anonymous classes is that if the implementation of your anonymous class is very simple, such as an interface that contains only one method, then the syntax of anonymous classes may seem unwieldy and unclear. In these cases, you're usually trying to pass functionality as an argument to another method, such as what action should be taken when someone clicks a button. Lambda expressions enable you to do this, to treat functionality as method argument, or code as data.

## <a name="q-14-9"></a> 14.9 Can you give an example of lambda expression?
Example:
```java
List<String> upper = new ArrayList<>();
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.forEach(item -> upper.add(item.toUpperCase()));
```

## Best Practices
## <a name="q-16-1"></a> 16.1 What are different techniques for avoiding != null statements (Not Null Check)?
This a quite common problem that junior to intermediate developers tend to face at some point: they either don't know or don't trust the contracts they are participating in and defensively overcheck for `null`s. Additionally, when writing their own code, they tend to rely on returning `nulls` to indicate something thus requiring the caller to check for `null`s.
To put this another way, there are two instances where null checking comes up:
1. Where `null` is a valid response in terms of the contract; and
2. Where it isn't a valid response.

(2) is easy. Either use `assert` statements (assertions) or allow failure (for example, `NullPointerException`). Assertions are a highly-underused Java feature that was added in 1.4. The syntax is:
```java
assert <condition>
```
or
```java
assert <condition> : <object>
```
where `<condition>` is a boolean expression and `<object>` is an object whose `toString()` method's output will be included in the error.

An assert statement throws an `Error` (`AssertionError`) if the condition is not true. By default, Java ignores assertions. You can enable assertions by passing the option `-ea` to the JVM. You can enable and disable assertions for individual classes and packages. This means that you can validate code with the assertions while developing and testing, and disable them in a production environment, although my testing has shown next to no performance impact from assertions.

(1) is a little harder. If you have no control over the code you're calling then you're stuck. If null is a valid response, you have to check for it.

If it's code that you do control, however (and this is often the case), then it's a different story. Avoid using nulls as a response. With methods that return collections, it's easy: return empty collections (or arrays) instead of nulls pretty much all the time.

With non-collections it might be harder. There you should make use of the `Null Object Pattern`

## <a name="q-16-2"></a> 16.2 How to avoid `NullPointerException` when comparing Strings?
Sometimes you may have to compare two Strings.
Without much thinking you could write code like this:
```java
public void testMyString(String testStr){
    testStr.equals("mySample");
}
```
But what happens if the `testStr` is or could be `null` due to bad design of the Software or because you can't change where you get the `String` from?
A `NullPointerException` will be thrown.\
You can easily improve the code so that no `Exception` will be thrown if the `String` you get to test is `null`:
```java
public void testMyString(String testStr){
    "mySample".equals(testStr);
}
```
This easy switch prevents your code from throwing a `NullpointerException` and helps your Software to keep stable. If the `testStr` is `null` the `equlas()` Method will automatically return `false` and the Software will work furtheron.

## <a name="q-16-3"></a> 16.3 How to concatenate Strings faster and more efficient?
If you append or modify a `String` inside of a loop or a lot of modifications are done with this `String` a `StringBuilder` should be used:
Bad example:
```java
private String example(){
    String result = "My Starting String";

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        result += " Some append(" + i + ")";
    }

    return result;
}
```
Improved Code:
```java
private String example(){
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("My Starting String");

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
        sb.append(" Some append(").append(i).append(")");
    }

    return sb.toString();
}
```

Another Improvement:

The starting point is something like this:
```java
String temp = "SELECT Item FROM Invoice WHERE id = '" + id + "'";
```
This code can be easily improved:
```java
String temp = "SELECT Item FROM Invoice WHERE id = '" + id + '\'';
```
This way the last add to the `String` will not be handled as `String`.Instead It will be handled as `char` and is an primitive datatype from java. This improvement gives the code a slightly better performance because only one `char` needs to be attatched instead of a potential Array of `char`s (like a `String` would be). The pervormance improvement from `a + "b"` to ` a + 'b'` is round about 10% (measured by benchmarks).\

Note:
> Except some people always saying you should use a `StringBuilder` for such cases: Java automatically uses a `StringBuilder` for such cases in the background. Only in loops or if a lot gets appended a explicit StringBuilder is better in performance and best practice.

## <a name="q-16-4"></a> 16.4 Which one should be used, “implements Runnable” vs. “extends Thread”?
Implementing `Runnable` is the preferred way to do it. You're not really specialising the thread's behaviour. You're just giving it something to run. That means composition is the philosophically "purer" way to go.

In practical terms, it means you can implement `Runnable` and extend from another class as well.
